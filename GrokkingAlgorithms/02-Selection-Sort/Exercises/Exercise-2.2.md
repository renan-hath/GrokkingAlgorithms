2.2. Suppose you’re building an app for restaurants to take customer orders. Your app needs to store a list of orders. Servers keep adding orders to this list, and chefs take orders off the list and make them. It’s an order queue: servers add orders to the back of the queue, and the chef takes the first order off the queue and cooks it. Would you use an array or a linked list to implement this queue? (Hint: Linked lists are good for inserts/deletes, and arrays are good for random access. Which one are you going to be doing here?)

> I'd use a linked list to implement this queue, since it has a lower run time for inserts and deletes (which are the two types of operations that will be happening frequently in this occasion), and random access to orders (which a linked list would fail at) won't occur, given that chefs will always take them from the start of the queue.
