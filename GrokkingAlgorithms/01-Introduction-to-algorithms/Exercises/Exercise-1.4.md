1.4. Give the run time for each of these scenarios in terms of big O.

You have a phone number, and you want to find the person’s name in the phone book. (Hint: You’ll have to search through the whole book!)

> Linear search could be used to search the name necessarily through the whole book. This algorithm has a run time of O(n).
