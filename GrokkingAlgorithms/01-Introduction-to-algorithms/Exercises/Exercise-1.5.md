1.4. Give the run time for each of these scenarios in terms of big O.

You want to read the numbers of every person in the phone book.

> Since the phone book is sorted alphabetically, and not numerically, linear search would be needed to search the given phone number, to discover the person's name. This algorithm has a run time of O(n).
> 
> ```
> runTime = O(n)
