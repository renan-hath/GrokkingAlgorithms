1.4. Give the run time for each of these scenarios in terms of big O.

You want to read the numbers of just the As.

> Although names starting with A are equivalent of only 1 out of 26 characters of the alphabet, they'd still have to be read linearly. As such, the number of operations used to read them would also grow at a linear rate. In which case, a linear search could be used, which has a run time of O(n).
